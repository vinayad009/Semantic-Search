About Infoblox 



Infoblox is a privately held IT automation and security which focuses on managing and identifying devices connected to networks—specifically for the Domain name system, Dynamic host configuration protocol, and IP address management.They are a modern, cloud-first networking and security.Their on-premises, cloud-native core networking and security services let you reliably automate and secure access to apps and services anytime, anywhere. 



The challenge 



Infoblox saw a spike in its business during the COVID-19 pandemic.With more employees working from home than ever before, businesses needed solutions like Infoblox to secure devices on their remote networks.Through this sustained growth period, the Infoblox sales organization needed to scale its enablement program and drive real-world impact on rep performance.The Infoblox team had access to many systems and resources, but wasn’t able to deliver measurable value in the absence of a systematic and interconnected platform that could build knowledge, arm reps with content, and track their field abilities.They also struggled with providing user access to different systems for enablement and content. Having multiple systems also meant that information was scattered and could not be analyzed effectively.The team needed a way to consolidate and simplify their tech stack for their growing business. 



The solution 



In order to make the switch from being reactive to a proactive sales enablement group, the team at Infoblox knew they needed a sales readiness platform to help them streamlinetheir training programs, content, and measurability.They were looking for a single platform that would help them manage all enablement activities including learning management, content management, knowledge reinforcement, and conversation intelligence.After comparing many vendors, the Infoblox team knew that Mindtickle was the only solution able to bring together all of their sales readiness initiatives in one place.
