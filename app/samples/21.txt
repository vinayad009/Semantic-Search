Better showcasing innovative technology 



Based in Toronto, Canada, ARHT is a pioneering global leader in live hologram technology. The company delivers memorable live interactions by capturing, transmitting, and beaming holograms of presenters as lifelike holograms to one or multiple places in real-time.While the company had great examples of its innovative technology in video and images saved on Google Drive, the ARHT sales team was spending hours looking for the right content to share with prospects.Andrew Dorcas, Senior Vice President of sales and strategy, at ARHT, explained, “We were innovative, but we weren’t getting the message out to the various industries that we wanted to in a way that was really compelling. We had great examples of our technology in the form of videos, and images, but adding them to various emails, or flipping as an attachment sometimes wasn’t getting that effectiveness across.”As it scaled, ARHT looked for a solution that could help the company tell compelling stories presented professionally. This included the ability to manage their content, optimize sales productivity, and gain insights into sales and content analytics. After an exhaustive review process, ARHT selected Mindtickle Digital Sales Rooms to bring their story to life. 



 
“At the end of the day, Mindtickle was ultimately the best choice based on the features, based on the pricing, and ultimately the customer service that we were given throughout the sales process.”

Deliver tailored buying experience in minutes 



With Mindtickle Digital Sales Room, sales reps could easily find the right asset, curate the content in digital sales rooms, and share with prospects and partners via a single link. This provided a single, online place for both sellers and buyers to collaborate.Before joining ARHT as EMEA sales director, Lyle Hastie was an ARHT partner. When he first received a Digital Sales Room, Hastie was impressed. “It was very tailored to the discussion that I’ve had with the salesperson,” he said.  “The virtual room painted a picture of how ARHT’s products and services worked, enabling me to view content relevant to me,” 











Digital Sales Rooms Speed up time to close 



By using digital sales rooms, ARHT gained valuable content and buyer engagement insights to augment its storytelling. The company could analyze data based on vertical, region, or product type to better make decisions on what content to develop, on which channels, and more. Buyer analytics on what content was viewed, for how long, and by whom enabled ARHT to optimize its sales motion. 




“We’ve closed considerable deals on this and we are measuring the revenue that has come from deals that have been created using the Mindtickle platform.”



Andrew Dorcas
Senior Vice President, Sales & Strategy, ARHT








Dorcas explained, “Beyond a shadow of a doubt, our time to close, using this specific sales enablement platform, is showing incredible results. We are seeing more and more improvement, and ultimately time to close from initial contact to getting signed contracts.”For ARHT, Mindtickle was the right choice, providing the company with the features, customer service, and product innovation that could meet the company’s needs today and tomorrow.
