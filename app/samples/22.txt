About PriceLabs 



PriceLabs is a powerful web-based revenue management & dynamic pricing software for vacation and short-term rentals that integrates with various Property Management Systems.Works with Airbnb, VRBO, Vacation Rentals, BnB’s, Apart-hotels, Serviced Apartments globally with No geographical constraints.PriceLabs help save time and increase income with their dynamic pricing tool and data solutions. 



The challenge 



PriceLabs, the leading revenue management platform for vacation and short-term rentals, wanted a solution to record customer calls so its product team could uncover customers’ sentiment and gain insight into their needs.In contrast, the product team felt there were new solutions that weren’t being pitched adequately.Recorded calls would help PriceLabs share feedback with the product team and also help identify where the team was missing the mark on explaining its product.This was especially important because PriceLabs doubled its team in the previous six months, and planned to double the team again in the following six months. 



The solution 



With Call AI, PriceLabs automatically records and transcribes reps’ customer meetings in real time, generating actionable insights based on the customer voice that informs decisions around product features and functionality.In addition, reps learn from real-life scenarios, accelerating onboarding and informing learning paths. 



The impact 



20% reduction in new rep ramp timeIncrease in win rates as a result of improved enablement efforts and ability to easily get feedback on deals from other teammatesImprovement in awareness and understanding of customer requirements for the product and services team
