About Trimble Viewpoint 



Trimble Viewpoint is a leading global provider of integrated software solutions for the construction industry.Their software enables customers to integrate construction operation and project management to improve project profitability, enhance productivity, manage risk, and effectively collaborate across the broad construction ecosystem. 



The Challenge 



Prior to 2018, Trimble Viewpoint didn’t have a sales onboarding program. New hires would onboard in a four-week in-person “bootcamp,” which was not a solution conducive to repeating or scaling.On top of this, it consumed all the time of the sales enablement team, which at the time was just two people.  



The solution 



With more than 8,000 clients worldwide, Trimble Viewpoint’s innovations are transforming the construction industry by fully integrating operations across financial and HR systems, project management tools, and mobile field solutions.In 2019, they hired 70 sellers — poised for growth, they needed a way to scale their sales enablement function.They deployed Mindtickle, launching their first onboarding program six months later. They used the analytics-driven enablement dashboards to track the readiness of the sales team, including course completions and certification. 



The impact 



Trimble Viewpoint currently has 553 active users in Mindtickle, with over 200 in sales.They reduced live training sessions by 75%; raised training completions to 90% and above for key initiatives.They continue to shorten the ramp time of new reps. They went from 69 days in 2019 to 52 days in 2021.Positive feedback from reps who participated in training and onboarding through Mindtickle; accelerated new representative onboarding, teaching them best practices that contribute to their success.
