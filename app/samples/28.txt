			The Mindtickle team has not just been a partner to me but also everyone at Aurigo who has been trying to work on their respective focus areas. It can be overwhelming for anyone who has to get things done without the necessary support, so that's been a great lift off of my shoulders to feel like Mindtickle is there to answer those questions and be supportive to the Aurigo team.
