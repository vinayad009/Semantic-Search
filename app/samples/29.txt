About Unisys 



Unisys is a worldwide information technology company that provides a portfolio of IT services, software, and technology that delivers successful outcomes for the most demanding business and governments.They’re among the largest government IT contractors, serving local, state, and federal agencies, as well as foreign governments. 



Challenges 



As Unisys has grown, so has the complexities of its sales training program.With over 800 enablement employees worldwide, it needed to improve its processing tools to provide more robust reporting and role- specific training.Unisys used multiple training platforms and manually assigned training,sent reminders, and tracked attendance in Excel spreadsheets.Without automation, the process was too complex and had potential for human error.The Global Enablement team wanted to implement a user- friendly online learning platform for onboarding, training and coaching, content development, and reporting.They reimagined its sales training process, researched solutions, and gained leadership buy-in to implement a new online training program. 



Solution 



Mindtickle was being utilized by the Unisys HR department but had not been implemented in its sales training program.The Mindtickle platform provided solutions to several challenges they faced.With its leadership’s support, the Global Enablement team began the migration process of moving its third-party programs into Mindtickle.In partnership with Mindtickle support and its third-party vendor, the importing process was seamless.They began testing the new platform by launching small pilot programs.After successful test launches, they developed a marketing plan to launch the platform to the entire go-to-market team.
