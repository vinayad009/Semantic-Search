About CM Group 



CM group has Martech industry’s largest family of email and multichannel marketing productsFounded in 2017 with the collection of three industry-leading email marketing platforms: Campaign Monitor, Delivra, and Emma.Created to offer solutions that meet the needs of every marketerThey allow clients to scale across brands as they grow, identifying the right solutions at every step of their journey. 



Challenges 



When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, CM Group’s entire company shifted to working remotely.This meant they were faced with a challenge they hadn’t experienced before: finding ways to onboard new hires virtually.On top of this, CM Group still had to train and motivate their existing employee base remotely.They had access to multiple enablement platforms but were struggling to streamline them into one consistent process. 



Solution 



With a pressing need to roll out onboarding and training programs remotely throughout the pandemic, CM Group’s enablement team opted to consolidate their enablement platforms to create the CM Group Knowledge Hub.The Knowledge Hub acts as a collaborative onboarding experience for new hires, while also serving as a source for regular updates for seasoned team members.By implementing new strategies like Missions using Mindtickle, CM Group is able to ensure their entire customer-facing team is trained on consistent messaging and processes. 



Impact 



After making the decision to consolidate platforms, CM Group experienced a fast and easy transition to MindtickleUpon implementing Mindtickle, CM Group saw a decrease in ramp time for customer-facing roles.CM Group quickly saw increased consistency in messaging across all of their customer- facing communications.With a sales readiness platform in place, employees at CM Group were being onboarded and trained effectively and consistently.
