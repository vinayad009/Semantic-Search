Inefficient content management for sales and marketing 



Based in San Mateo, CA, Talview offers an end-to-end AI-powered hiring and proctoring solution. With a mission to ensure every person can achieve their best career, the company provides organizations with digital tools to make more efficient, informed decisions throughout the lifecycle of their talent, from recruiting to credentialing. Yet, the company’s sales team was unable to find and share content with their customers. They needed an easier way to curate and manage marketing collateral for a sales team located in the United States, United Kingdom, and India. At the time, sales collateral was saved on personal computers or in different folders on Google Drive. There was also a Google Sheet, Jira board, and wiki set up to share links to the sales collateral. Sales spent valuable time searching for content, requesting content from marketing, or using outdated collateral. According to Amy Wood, Director of Marketing at Talview, “We were seeking a straightforward tool that could be used by our sales teams across several time zones. We needed a single source of truth that all of our stakeholders – sales, customer success, marketing, executives – could use.” 



 
“What it all comes down to is that Mindtickle has really been a partner to us. Along with all the enhancements they’ve made based on our feedback, using them as our single source of content has been a success with our sales teams. We’re now extending the digital sales room to be a customer relationship tool with our Customer Success team.”



Amy Wood
Director of Marketing, Talview
















From content management to buyer-centric enablement 



For Talview, Mindtickle not only provided a streamlined solution to curate, manage, and share content with sales, but also addressed other needs for the sales and marketing teams. “We quickly discovered that Mindtickle was more than a content repository,” explained Wood. “For example, Digital Sales Rooms could empower our sales team to create digital experiences with content tailored to our customers’ needs. Instead of sending an email with multiple attachments, our sales reps can send a single link and know when the customer viewed or shared the link. That’s very powerful.” The ability to share a piece of content with a prospect and analyze data from those shares, was a significant value proposition. The marketing team gained visibility into who engaged with content, for how long, content gaps, and more. The team could make data-driven decisions on how to improve content. Moreover, the deal room activity integrated with the company’s Salesforce instance, providing sales with more intelligence on prospects. Talview’s sales, marketing and customer service teams benefitted from these additional offerings from Mindtickle: Customer reference management – At the time, the company was aggressively pursuing a customer advocacy program. Typically, the process required a 30-60 minute conference call and multiple email exchanges to finalize a single quote. With Mindtickle, the customer marketing team could send a single link requesting video, audio or text-based testimonials, and customers could respond at their leisure.Customer support – Since Talview’s sales team is split across three regions, onboarding sales on a new sales enablement tool required coordination. Mindtickle helped the company with training, scheduling across multiple time zones, and implementation.  











Empowering sales and marketing 



With 40 sales, marketing, and customer success users, Talview now has meaningful insights into the buyer journey, customer experience, and sales onboarding process. “Before Mindtickle, we had no insight into how our content was being used by sales, and we were relying solely on sales sentiment,” explained Wood. Because of Mindtickle, Talview’s sales team creates digital buying experiences tailored to their customer’s needs and sales journey. Buyers are empowered to navigate the buying journey to make buying decisions.  




“Mindtickle reframes the conversations I have with my sales and executive teams. I can share data on how sellers and buyers are engaging with our content throughout the buying process and make smarter decisions as a result.” 



Amy Wood
Director of Marketing, Talview








Mindtickle revolutionized Talview sales and marketing operations. With the ability to easily curate, manage, and track sales content and assets, alongside Reference Management for customer testimonials, and Digital Sales Rooms for personalized content sharing, Talview experienced a significant transformation. Combined with insights into seller and buyer behaviors and CRM integration, centralized assets, onboarded teams, and tripled customer references, marking a remarkable success story for Talview growth and customer engagement.
