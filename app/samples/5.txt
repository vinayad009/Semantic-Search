Procore Achieves Excellence with Structured Sales Enablement and Onboarding 



About Procore 



Procore is a software company that provides cloud-based construction management software.It allows teams of construction companies, property owners, project managers, contractors, and partners to collaborate on construction projects and share access to documents, planning systems and data, using an Internet-connected device.The software includes features such as meeting minutes, drawing markups and document storage for all project-related materials. 



Challenges 



When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, CM Group’s entire company shifted to working remotely.This meant they were faced with a challenge they hadn’t experienced before: finding ways to onboard new hires virtually.On top of this, CM Group still had to train and motivate their existing employee base remotely.They had access to multiple enablement platforms but were struggling to streamline them into one consistent process. 



Challenge 



Procore’s sales team was growing rapidly, and with that, they were having difficulty gauging the performance of their team.Because their team was expanding so quickly, Procore was also struggling to keep salespeople up-to-date on constantly evolving product, industry, and competitive information.With such a fast-growing team, aligning their core messaging and sales process became a challenge.This included hiring new reps and ramping them up quickly.To go along with this, managing and delivering sales collateral in a way that ensured a consistent customer experience was something the Procore team wanted to do, but wasn’t able to scale.They knew they needed to implement a structured sales enablement program. Alex Jaffe, Sales Enablement Manager for Procore, played a critical role in executing this strategy. 



Solution 



Sales enablement at Procore was structured into two distinct categories: segment based and functional based.All roles within the categories functioned as a conduit between sales and the different departments involved in each initiative.The distinction based on functions and initiatives helped Procore handle their overall sales enablement program with ease.Using Mindtickle, Procore facilitated a structured, streamlined, and outcome oriented onboarding process to ensure their reps were set up for success.The first 90 days would be the initial onboarding phase, and from then on it would be about continual improvement, called ongoing enablement. 







Impact 



Procore has more than a 90% adoption of content and sales enablement technology by reps.Sales reps rate the overall program 4.8/5 according to their internal NPS survey99% of Procore’s sales reps recommend the programCore sales messaging at Procore has remained consistent amidst hyper growthReps are up-to-date on constantly evolving product, industry, and competitive information
